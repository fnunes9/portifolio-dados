# 🐍 Project: Python for Data Manipulation and Visualization

This repository contains my studies and practical exercises from the **Python** course in my **Data Engineering** postgraduate program.  
Here, I’m consolidating my skills in **data extraction, manipulation, visualization, and integration** from various sources.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

My goal in this stage is to strengthen my ability to use **Python as a data analysis tool**, developing skills to:

- Extract information from multiple formats (databases, files, and APIs);
- Manipulate, transform, and clean datasets;
- Create visualizations that support interpretation and decision-making;
- Write clean, structured, and reusable code.

## ⚙️ Learning Methods

- Theoretical review of Python fundamentals;  
- Practical exercises and problem-solving;  
- Development of scripts and notebooks to consolidate learning.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

All notebooks in this repository were developed in **Google Colab**.

To run them:

1. Find the desired `.ipynb` file;
2. Make a **copy to your Google Drive** ; 
4. Run the cells normally inside Colab.  

> 💡 The environment already includes the main libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly`.  
> If you need additional dependencies, simply install them directly in Colab using:
> ```python
> !pip install library-name
> ```
